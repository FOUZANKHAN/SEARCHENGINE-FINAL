Project Milestone 1
what it does?
Performs positional inverted indexing on 36000 documents of JSON files. 
Positional inverted index is a datastructure to store each and every doc content in an efficient way along with it's positions
Takes about 3 ~4 mins to index all the documents.
What else can it perform?
It can perform query searches /Boolean style
1. If you want  to find a document with a combine term such as "national park"
> It will give all the document with all the documents that have national park in that order
2. If the document contains term x and term y
> the query would be Termx<space>TermY
3. If the document contains termx or termy
> TermX<+>termy
4. If the document cpntains termx at a distance of two words
for eg "New York is where I shouldn't go"
New is at a distance of 1 word from is
> [New NEAR/2 is] //2 here means at a position +1


Project Milestone 2
Disk Indexing
Main file is Projectmilestone2v2
We performed disk indexing i.e saving the index to the disk.
stored it in gaps.
Format of the disk stored index is 
<dft,docid,tftd,p1,p2,p3,----pn>
Dft = Documents that contain the term
docid = number of the doc or doc id
tftd = number of times that term is in the document
p1 = first position and so on.
secondly, the documents and positions are saved as gaps i.e doc 3, doc 5 have the term then it is saved as, 3,5-3,x-(5-3) so on, same for positions.
It also does ranked retrivals for both phrase and boolean queries
default, tf-idf, okapi bm25, wacky strategies.

Project Milestone 3
Calculates MEAN Average Precision, Mean Response Time and Throughput for all the different ranking strategies. It also performs vocabulary elimination and elimates
the documents with low wqt(wieght of query terms) designated a threshold.

DIFFERENT THRESHOLDS COMPARISON FOR DEFAULT 
------------------------------------------------------
Threshold = 0.8
MAP = 0.203
Throughput = 63.109
MRT = 0.015
------------------------------------------------------
Threshold = 1.0
MAP = 0.181
Throughput = 113.715
MRT = 0.00879
------------------------------------------------------
Threshold = 1.4(SELECTED THIS FOR HIGHEST MAP and Throughput)
MAP = 0.258
Throughput = 132.79
MRT = 0.0075
